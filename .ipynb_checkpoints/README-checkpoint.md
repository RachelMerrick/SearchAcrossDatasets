# Search across State Library's family history datasets

State Library of Queensland has released a number of family history datasets on the Queensland Government Open Data Portal.

On the portal, you must individually download each file and manually search inside of it.

Instead of downloading each family history dataset and searching through individually, use this tool to search for names and keywords across State Library's open data on family history.

This Jupyter notebook allows you to search across multiple datafiles without the need to download. If the results show you the file will be useful, you can then download directly from the notebook.
