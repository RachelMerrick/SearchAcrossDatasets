# Search across State Library's family history datasets

State Library of Queensland has released a number of family history datasets on the <a href="https://www.data.qld.gov.au/organization/state-library-queensland">Queensland Government Open Data Portal.</a>

Instead of downloading each family history dataset from the portal and searching through individually, use this tool to search across the open datasets using the portal's API.

This Jupyter notebook allows you to search across multiple datafiles without the need to download. After seeing results, you can then download directly from the notebook. 

<b>Launch this interactive Jupyter Notebook in your own browser using Binder</b>
It will open in 'Appmode', but you can click 'Edit App' at the top of the notebook to access the code.
